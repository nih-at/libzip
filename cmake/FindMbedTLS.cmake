FindMbedTLS
-------

Finds the Mbed TLS library.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module provides the following imported targets, if found:

``MbedTLS::mbedcrypto``
  The Mbed TLS library

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will define the following variables:

``MbedTLS_FOUND``
  True if the system has the Mbed TLS library.
``MbedTLS_VERSION``
  The version of the Mbed TLS library which was found.
``MbedTLS_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Include directories needed to use Mbed TLS.
``MbedTLS_LIBRARIES``
  Libraries needed to link to Mbed TLS.

Cache Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``MbedTLS_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The directory containing ``mbedtls/aes.h``.
``MbedTLS_LIBRARY``
  The path to the Mbed TLS library.
