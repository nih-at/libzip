API Plans
=========

Encryption
----------
struct zip *zip_open_encrypted(const char *path, int flags,
                               const char *password, int *errorp);

int zip_set_encryption(struct zip *archive, zip_uint64_t idx,
    		       zip_uint16_t method, const char *password);
void zip_set_archive_encryption(struct zip *archive,
     				zip_uint16_t method, const char *password);

API Issues
==========
* character encoding in file names and comments (allow non-UTF8)
  Replacement functions with flags:
  * zip_archive_set_comment
  * zip_file_add
  * zip_file_rename
  * zip_file_set_comment
* use this case to go over all function names and make them consistent
  (e.g., zip_*_file_extra_* -> zip_file_*)
* clean up first version of extra field support
* compression/crypt implementations: how to set error code on failure
* compression/crypt error messages a la ZIP_ER_ZLIB (no detailed info passing)


Features
========
* read InfoZIP extra fields for UTF-8 file name/file comment
* set "version needed" correctly for zip64
* Implement missing extra field functions
* Document extra field functions
* Document API changes
  . _set_name allows NULL (document)
  . old extra fields API removed
  . change in return value of get_comment: NULL if error, else pointer to empty array and len=0
  . add ZIP_DISABLE_DEPRECATED and rename deprecated functions so they are only available when it's not set

* I/O methods
* do not compress if storing is smaller
* support streaming output (creating new archive to e.g. stdout)
* add functions to:
  . set last modification time for entry
  . read/set ASCII file flag? (wiz: more general options?)
  . get/set "version made by" and "external file attributes"
    (can be used to decide if an entry is a directory, if the
     archive was created on DOS)
* zip_commit (to finish changes without closing archive)
* add custom compression function support
* support for old compression methods?????
* zip_source_zip: allow rewinding
* zipcmp: add option for file content comparison
* zipcmp: compare bit flags
* append to files (for self-extracting files)
* consistency: compare number of entries with cdir value
* consistency: for stored files, test compressed = uncompressed


Bugs
====
* check inconsistent file test case result
* fix build dir runtest (bigzero.zip)
* zip_replace: set compression method to default unless user-set
* reset compression specific bits in bitflags when (re)compressing
* split zip archive torrentzip state from user requested torrentzip state
* check for limits imposed by format (central dir size, file size, ...)
* set "version of encoding software" to proper value
* _zip_u2d_time: handle localtime(3) failure
* missing -Wl,-R in pkg-config file
* zip_open: consistency check: check data descriptor
* POSIX: zip_open: check whether file can be created and fail if not
* POSIX: fix permissions of new file to match old one
* fix inconsistent usage of valid flags (not checked in many places)
* cdr == NULL -> ER_NOENT vs. idx > cdir->nentry -> ER_INVAL inconsistent (still there?)

Cleanup
=======
* get rid of zip_get_{compression,encryption}_implementation
* use zip_*int*_t internally
* completely get rid of off_t


Consistency
===========
* check arguments for every entry point into libzip
* check that local headers come before central dir


Test Case Issues
================
* test calls against old API
* run regression tests also from CMake framework
* rename file to dir/ and vice versa (fails)
* fix comment test to be newline insensitive

* (add, replace)
	add to empty zip
	add to existing zip
	add w/ existing file name [E]
	replace ok
	replace w/ illegal index [E]
	replace w/ deleted name [E]
	unchange added/replaced file
* (close)
	copy zip file
	open copy
	rename, delete, replace, add w/ new name, add w/ deleted name
	close
	zipcmp copy expected
	remove copy
* (error_get)
* (error_get_sys_type)
* (error_to_str)
* (extra_fields)
* (file_error_get)
* (file_strerror)
* (replace)
* (source_buffer)
* (source_file)
* (source_filep)
* (source_free)
* (source_function)
* (source_zip)
* (strerror)
* (unchange)
* (unchange_all)
