.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_register_cancel_callback_with_state
.Nd allow cancelling during zip_close
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Vt typedef int (*zip_cancel_callback)(zip_t *, void *);
.Ft void
.Fn zip_register_cancel_callback_with_state "zip_t *archive" "zip_cancel_callback callback" "void (*ud_free)(void *)" "void *ud"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function can be used to cancel writing of a zip archive during
.Xr zip_close 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn zip_register_cancel_callback_with_state
function registers a callback function
.Ar callback
for the zip archive
.Ar archive .
The
.Ar ud_free
function is called during cleanup for deleting the userdata supplied in
.Ar ud .
.Pp
The callback function is called during
.Xr zip_close 3
in regular intervals (after every zip archive entry that's completely
written to disk, and while writing data for entries) with zip archive
.Ar archive ,
and the user-provided user-data
.Ar ud
as arguments. When the callback function returns a non-zero value, writing is cancelled.
.Pp
The callback function should be fast, since it will be called often.
