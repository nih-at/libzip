.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to cancel writing of a zip archive during
zip_close(3).
.PP
The
\fBzip_register_cancel_callback_with_state\fR()
function registers a callback function
\fIcallback\fR
for the zip archive
\fIarchive\fR.
The
\fIud_free\fR
function is called during cleanup for deleting the userdata supplied in
\fIud\fR.
.PP
The callback function is called during
zip_close(3)
in regular intervals (after every zip archive entry that's completely
written to disk, and while writing data for entries) with zip archive
\fIarchive\fR,
and the user-provided user-data
\fIud\fR
as arguments. When the callback function returns a non-zero value, writing is cancelled.
.PP
The callback function should be fast, since it will be called often.
